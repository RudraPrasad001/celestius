## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **pnpm**: Follow the installation instructions at [pnpm.io](https://pnpm.io/installation).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/celestius.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd celestius
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using `pnpm`:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

The development server supports hot-reloading, so you can make changes to your code and see them reflected immediately without restarting the server.

### Editing Pages

You can start editing the pages by modifying the files in the `app` directory, such as `app/page.tsx`. Your changes will automatically be reflected in the browser.

### Using `next/font`

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) for font optimization and loading Google Fonts efficiently. Learn more in the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization).

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command generates a `.next` folder with a highly optimized static build of your site.

To serve the production build locally, run:

```bash
pnpm start
```
